## Intro to Jasmine JS Tests and classes in JS

In the main.js file, there is simple a User class that contains two methods (updateName and toggleStatus).

I have added comments for those that haven't gotten to the class section for JS in your Exercism exercises. This repository is mainly to make sure you are able to run Jasmine tests with your Live Server.

# To run the tests

- [ ] Make sure you are in the correct directory and click "Go Live" to run your Live Server
- [ ] It should then run your index.html in your browser
- [ ] If you change some of the code in the main.py, you will see the page dynamically update and has beneficial information for the potential reason the tests have failed.
